# pull-request-comment-action-sample
Just a small sample to test triggering a GitHub action when someone comments on a PR and then getting that relevant branch.

You can check [the comment on this PR](https://github.com/KristofferStrube/pull-request-comment-action-sample/pull/1#issuecomment-1632069053) to see how the action has successfully checked out the PR branch, read its README.md file and reacted to the original comment.
